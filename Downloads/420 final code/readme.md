# Sudoku Solver

### Requirements:

- Python 3.8.2
- Cupy
- pygame

If you are on windows then the best way to get Cupy is to install it using Anaconda https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cupy and running the code with an anaconda environment/interpreter.

You can definitely skip this step and just try the sequential version (sudoku.py) since both programs are the same except for the parallel part.

### How to Run:

- To run the <u>GUI</u>, run **sudoku.py** and type **1**
- To run the <u>CLI</u>, run **sudoku.py** and type **2**
